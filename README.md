# Data Science for Banking Domain

This repository is dedicated to exploring and analyzing datasets relevant to the banking sector. The primary focus is on fraud detection, risk assessment, and financial analytics using machine learning and data visualization techniques.

## Datasets and Analyses
The following table summarizes the datasets analyzed in this repository, along with the challenges faced and the methods applied:




| Dataset Name | Description | Challenges | Analysis Performed | Download |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Credit Card Fraud Detection** | Machine learning-based fraud detection system that helps identify fraudulent transactions. | Highly imbalanced dataset, feature importance analysis. | Explored feature distributions, applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest, MLP, and LSTM, visualized fraud patterns. | [![My Skills](https://skills-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=github)](https://github.com/pipe1223/deepFraud/tree/master/Fraud)|
| **Fraud Detection Dataset** | Focus on feature engineering and explainability in fraud detection. | Complex timestamp conversion, transaction patterns over time. | Extracted time-based features (day of week, hour), applied ML models, analyzed fraud trends. | [![My Skills](https://skills-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goyaladi/fraud-detection-dataset/data) [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=github)](https://github.com/pipe1223/deepFraud/tree/master/credit_risk)|
| **IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection** | Large-scale dataset for fraud detection in online transactions. | High-dimensional data, complex feature engineering, data merging. | Implemented LightGBM, engineered new features, optimized large-scale data processing. | [![My Skills](https://skills-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection) [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=github)](https://github.com/pipe1223/deepFraud/tree/master/CIS_Fraud)|
