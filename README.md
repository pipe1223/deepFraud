# **DeepFraud: AI-powered Fraud Detection System**

ðŸš€ **DeepFraud** is a machine learning-based fraud detection system that helps identify fraudulent transactions using multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, MLP, and LSTM. The application provides **real-time fraud risk analysis**, **feature importance visualization**, and **detailed explanations** for each transaction.
